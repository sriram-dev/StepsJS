		<div class="steps_title"> 1. Aim to educate yourself.  </div>
		<div class="steps_desc">
			Keep in mind an education isn't the junk you are forced to do in school for diplomas and degrees; it's an understanding of the world around you. People who are naturally curious for some reason begin to stop asking questions the moment they hit school. The truly brilliant mind however, always questions their world and tries to make sense of it. That is the secret to "genius".

				<li>Try <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Become-an-Adult-Self-Learner" title="Become an Adult Self Learner" class="mw-redirect">teaching yourself</a>. You can even learn from your life experiences, sometimes called "<a href="/Unschool-Yourself-and-Your-Children" title="Unschool Yourself and Your Children">unschooling</a>".</li>

		<div class="steps_title"> 2. - Work on your vocabulary </div>
		<div class="steps_desc"> Use a few definitions from the <a href="/Use-a-Dictionary" title="Use a Dictionary">dictionary</a> each day, or subscribe to a "word-of-the-day" service online. You can also take 	the vocabulary tests in Readers Digest or buy a book on increasing your working vocabulary. Read the dictionary one letter at a time. This will take you at least a year but you will grow 
			intellectually.

		<div class="steps_title"> 3. - Read a variety of books. </div>
		<div class="steps_desc"> Reading a lot is often described as the secret to intelligence. The smartest people in the world tend to read every single day. You may not always enjoy it, but reading will open 
			up your mind to a variety of new ideas and experiences. Keep your reading diverse by reading books of all genres including non-fiction. 
            <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Image:Be-Smart-Step-3.jpg"><img alt="Be Smart Step 3.jpg" src="http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Be-Smart-Step-3.jpg/670px-Be-Smart-Step-3.jpg" width="670" height="503"></a>

		<div class="steps_title"> Step 4 - Educate yourself about the world around you. </div>
		<div class="steps_desc">  Cultivate an interest in subjects like current events, interesting facts, funny and inspiring quotations, good books and movies, scientific studies and interesting inventions. 
			Educational television, like PBS, is a great way to learn. Learning to think critically about the world around you by being aware of cause and effect in events will make you much smarter.			
			<ul>
				<li>If you can read much faster than you can speak, it is much more efficient to read a book, or better yet a non-linear electronic document like a wiki than to watch a show for all but the most intellectually demanding or video-dependent learning. Commercial television is particularly bad because its ultimate purpose is to do just enough to keep you at the TV and its ads, not satisfy you so you can do something else.
				</li>

		<div class="steps_title"> 5 - Make connections. </div>
		<div class ="steps_desc"> Find uses for information, rather than just collecting useless trivia. Burying information somewhere deep in your brain is not useful; you have to be able to access it in real-	
			world situations. Think of real-world situations in which a piece of information will make sense. Then share it and watch it grow!
